I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University working broadly at the intersection of development economics, labor economics and economic history.

My research focuses on understanding the sources of growth and inequality and can be organized into two themes: (1) How the reforms in the public sector affected human capital formation and allocation, as well as structural transformation in China; (2) sources of gender inequality and gender convergence in developing countries. I approach these questions by applying up-to-date econometric tools to administrative, survey, and archival data to draw rigorous conclusions.

Prior to enrolling at BU, I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics (2015) and a Master of Arts degree in Economics (2017) from Peking University. 

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews during the 2022-2023 ASSA Annual Meeting.
