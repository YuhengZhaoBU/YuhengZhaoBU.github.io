I am an applied economist working broadly at the intersection of agricultural production, the environment and human health, with a particular emphasis on biotechnology, climate change, and sustainability issues. My past work has comprehensively evaluated the policy consequences of restricting glyphosate (a dominant herbicide) use in corn production by weighing its environmental and human health gain against economic loss in a monetary framework. My current research focuses on climate and sustainability issues: (1) the adaptive value of drought-tolerance (DT) technology and the moral hazard in DT adoption, and (2) the sustainable use of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) crops to preserve pest susceptibility as a common pool resource.    

Prior to enrolling at MSU, I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics and Management from Zhejiang University in 2017. Since 2020, I have also worked as a consultant in the Development Research Group, the World Bank, conducting agricultural policy analysis in developing countries.
