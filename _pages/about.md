I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University working broadly at the intersection of development economics and labor economics.

Prior to enrolling at BU, I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics (2015) and a Master of Arts degree in Economics (2017) from Peking University. 

I am on the job market this year and available for interviews during the 2022-2023 ASSA Annual Meeting.
