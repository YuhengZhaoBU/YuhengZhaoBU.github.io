**1. The Game of Corn Rootworm Control with Bt Crops**. **Ziwei Ye**  
&nbsp;
**Abstract**
The corn rootworm is a major corn pest that costs the US economy an estimated one billion dollars per year. To reduce rootworm damage, corn growers plant genetically engineered hybrids that produce rootworm-active Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. We provide the first empirical evidence of areawide suppression from rootworm Bt corn hybrids, using a unique and representative panel on corn root damage in non-Bt experimental fields and regional Bt corn coverage from 2003 to 2016 in the Corn Belt. Findings are consistent in suggesting a significant yield benefit from suppressive Bt corn planting, but the pest suppression is effective only when regional Bt coverage level is sufficiently high, i.e., greater than 63%. This is followed by a synthesis of game theory and biological modeling that formalizes the inconsistency between voluntary and group-optimal in the presence of two countervailing externalities: free-riding incentives arising from area suppression, and susceptibility resource depletion. The theoretical analysis shows that at the current Bt coverage level, voluntary planting exceeds the group-optimal level. The policy implications for sustainable pest management are discussed.
