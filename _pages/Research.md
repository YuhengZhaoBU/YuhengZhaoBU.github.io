# Working Papers
[**1. The Long-term and Distributional Effects of School Consolidations: Evidence from China**.](https://github.com/YuhengZhaoBU/YuhengZhaoBU.github.io/blob/master/files/JMP 1_Yuheng ZHAO_Updated.pdf) (Job Market Paper 1, under review)    
This paper investigates the allocative consequences of school consolidation, a globally pervasive phenomenon in response to the demographic transition. Rural out-migration and fertility decline during the process of development motivates policymakers in developing countries to close schools in remote and less populated rural areas. I study the impacts of the largest primary school consolidation ever implemented, using the China Health and Nutrition Survey between 1989 and 2015. Employing a generalized Difference-in-Difference (DID) framework that is robust to the heterogeneous treatment effects, I find that school consolidations increased females’ education but not males’ education. In contrast, treated individuals of both genders had higher earnings. I provide suggestive evidence consistent with the mechanisms of enhanced labor market proximity and gender equity after school consolidations. The analysis of the distributional effects indicates that individuals in the middle part of income distribution benefited more from school consolidations, and the increase in inequality was relatively small compared to the efficiency increase. My paper is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of the distributional effects which is critical to policy evaluation. The trade-offs initiated by the school consolidations analyzed in this paper could apply to many other contexts. 

[**2. Government Brain Drain: Earning, Firm Entry, and Talent Reallocation in Chinese Public Sector Hiring Reform**.](https://github.com/YuhengZhaoBU/YuhengZhaoBU.github.io/blob/master/files/JMP 2_Yuheng ZHAO_Updated.pdf) (Job Market Paper 2)      
&nbsp;
This paper provides reduced form causal evidence on how talent reallocation from the public sector contributed to entrepreneurship and innovation, in a unique Chinese public sector reform in 1994. The reform terminated guaranteed public sector job allocation for tertiary graduates, greatly reducing labor mobility costs across sectors. To alleviate the endogeneity that regions with more tertiary graduates were also more exposed to other reforms, I construct a novel dataset of the tertiary graduate number in different majors across prefectures and pair it with administrative data of firm entry in particular industries. I use three different identification strategies to study the causal impacts of this reform: DID, Regression-Discontinuity Design (RDD), and Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuity (DRD). I find that after the reform, tertiary graduate earnings decreased, and more tertiary graduates worked in the private sector or became entrepreneurs. The resulting talent reallocation led to a boom in the private sector. After the reform, prefectures with more tertiary students who graduated from industry-related majors experienced greater entry of private firms in those industries. The reform also stimulated market-oriented innovation activities such as market design patents and trademarks.

# Work in Progress
**1. Fiscal Decentralization and Resource Misallocation: Evidence from China**. with Marialuz Moreno Badia and W. Raphael Lam (Draft coming soon)           
Can fiscal decentralization and associated regional disparities explain resource misallocation in China? Using a sample of over 300,000 manufacturing firms for the period 1998-2007, we quantify the extent of misallocation and find that vertical imbalance is correlated with a wide efficiency dispersion across provinces. To alleviate potential endogeneity caused by reverse causality and omitting variables, we instrument the funding gap of local government by the product of each province's average share in national transfer and the total net transfer in a given year. Empirical estimates suggest that higher vertical imbalances led to larger across-province differences. The channels appear to be related to a lack of local government funding resulting in financial constraints at the firm level and a larger distortion in the land market.
