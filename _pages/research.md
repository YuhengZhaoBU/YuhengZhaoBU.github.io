*Abstract* Since 1996, transgenic Bt maize (or Bt corn), which contains transgenes from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has progressed from containing one plant-incorporated protectant per hybrid to multiple stacked and pyramided traits in the same hybrid. Early Bt genes protected against corn borers such as Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer, ECB), with limited protection against other lepidopteran pests that feed on kernels. In 2003, the first Bt hybrids with protection against Diabrotica virgifera (western corn rootworm, CRW) were planted, and later years saw the stacking of traits to protect against multiple insect pests, as well as to confer herbicide and drought tolerance. We determined if these transgenic traits indirectly protected against aflatoxin and drought risk by analyzing crop insurance claims made by United States corn growers from 2003-2016. Hybrids containing lepidopteran protection alone or stacked with CRW traits protected against aflatoxin risk, with a greater effect in stacked events. Both lepidopteran and CRW traits showed reduced drought damage, with the strongest effect in CRW-protected corn, which may be because healthier root systems improved water utilization.

**The impact of land market openning in Ukraine.** (with Klaus W. Deininger, Donald F. Larson, Oleg Nivievskyi, and Anna Harus)  
*Abstract* On July 1, 2021, the Government of Ukraine lifted a moratorium on agricultural land sales that had been in place for more than 20 years. The new policy affects 7 million landowners and nearly 71 percent of all land in Ukraine. Land valuations are rising in anticipation of the new policies and are expected to rise further as reforms are fully implemented. This paper uses farm-level data from 2016-2019 to estimate a translog cost function for Ukraine’s gain and oilseed subsector, which account for 29 32 percent of the country’s export earnings. We use the model, in combination with a hedonic pricing model, to simulate the impacts of forecasted land-prices increases and declines in implicit transaction costs on production costs, land and labor use, and technology choice. Simulations suggest that published forecasted land-price increases in excess of 50 percent are unlikely because of the disruptive displacement of land from the subsector needed to sustain such increases. The estimated model reveals little variation in applied production technologies across farm size and simulations also show that the policy impacts are similar except for the smallest farms in our sample. The simulations do show some variation in regional impacts, due to differences in transaction costs and labor markets.
